              <br> <br>
              <p>My name is Brittany Agha, and I am a Senior at Towson University. For my whole life I thought I would end up a 
                podiatrist, but last minute I decided to purse a career in tech. I attened CCBC at first, and got
                 my associates of science in Computer Science and continued my journey here at Towson. Outside of tech, there
                 are mnany things I like to like play the piano, sing, dance, act, read, make music, and more. I like sining and making 
                 music the most because it's when I get to be most expressive, and I love making songs with my friends.
